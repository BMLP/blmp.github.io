about_us: >
  <p>After working in Ferguson, Baltimore, and Cleveland, lawyers and legal activists have come
  together to create the Black Movement-Law Project. BMLP provides legal support to local
  communities throughout the country as they demonstrate against police brutality and
  systemic racism. We believe in a community centered approach providing holistic legal
  and technical service with an understadnding that mass defense movement legal
  experience is often missing from the local equation.</p><p> BMLP facilitates a rapid
  response system supporting activists during mass demonstrations and arrests. We
  work with local community groups to educate impacted communities in understanding
  their rights and responding to increased militarized police presence in their
  communities.</p><p> Our work includes legal observation and traditional know your
  rights trainings, as well as emergency infrastructure such as jail support
  mechanisms designed to meet the needs of the specific community. Further we have a
  network of national human and civil rights lawyers that assist local communities in
  urgent legal needs and long-term impact litigation.</p>
